Hello! My name is Von Taylor and I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and I am looking to gain real-world experience in the technology field through internships! I have an interest in software development mobile application development, and full-stack development. I have experience in the Java, C, C++, Kotlin, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, and ARM programming languages, with Java being my current most comfortable language.

Nice to meet you!
